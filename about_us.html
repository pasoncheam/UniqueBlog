                <h4>Pason Cheam Tung Huay</h4>
                <p>Hi! I am Pason Cheam Tung Huay, the group leader for Team UNIque Blog. Borned in 2003, as for my age, you do the maths. If you are wondering why my first name is Pason instead of Jason or Jackson or whatever, that is because Pason is a Thai name. My real Thai name is Prachem Sanchan, I am a Northeastern Isaan (Thai/Lao) and Chinese Malaysian and currently residing in Selangor to resume my tertiary studies. I am now taking Foundations in Science (Engineering) in UCSI University and now in my first year second semester.
<br><br>
I loved playing the piano and have been doing so since 6 years old up until now, though I have less time to pursue my musical interest due to time constraints. Other than music, I also have a fiery passion for Innovation and I express it through programming, hence the reason I chose this very course. As someone who started his coding journey late, my coding skills are not as refined as my music, but I will keep striving in becoming better! One more fun fact about me is that I love to watch The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon. I find many things that I could relate to in both of these movies, for instance, being an introvert who has hardship in various social conventions, and struggling with challenges in the academic world. Last but not least, my dream is to obtain a research position at Chiang Mai University Thailand. The view and scenery around the university are marvelous and Thailand also represents my home in my heart.</p>

                <h4>Kee Huai Shen</h4>
                <p>I was born on 17th May 2003, currently 18 years old as of now. I was born in Perak, Hutang Melintang. My hometown is a very old town and my grandfather worked together with other relatives and ran a fish factory. They also hired fishermen to catch fish. I am currently a student studying at UCSI University, and the course I took is Foundation in Science(Engineering). I am a student from September 2021 intake, and it is my first year second semester now. For hobbies, I like sports, arts, and gaming. I’ve made up my mind not long ago, to only do things that I enjoy doing as long as it’s right and controllable. As for life goals, I have yet to find one, but I plan to slowly materialize it as I take slow and steady steps into the future. I was the president of the scouts' organization during my secondary school, SMJK Chong Hwa, and I can’t help but appreciate the great experiences of being a scout. I have met various people, gone to different places, gained irreplaceable memories, made precious friends along the way. I am able to experience such memorable moments thanks to the activeness of the scout activities. Many times I had felt nothing but despair and stress from the constant high demanding activities but I am truly grateful that I never once gave up and stepped away from my responsibilities. If you were to ask me, I value the relationship and connections between people more than anything else.
            <br><br>
For me, I think it is important to meet as many people as possible and make new friends along the way. You never know who will be useful to you or able to gift you valuable life lessons. Even though people tend to say “Only make true friends”, doesn’t that apply to everyone else? People wished to get friends that can be true to themselves, the same applies to others too. Thus although making a few true friends is a great choice, isn't having friends you can rely on, trust, meet and chat anywhere even better? The world is not as big as we seem anyway, and we will be bound to meet each other on our way sometime in the future. My favorite Chinese teacher once said, ‘We are all on a train that directs us towards an inevitable death, people will come and go, while not many will stay with you until the last station’. It serves different meanings depending on the perspective you see it but it does not have any relation to anything I said before, the quote just hits deep in my heart in some way that I can’t explain.

                <p>My name is Wong Min Jze and I was born on 5th May 2003. I’m currently 18 years old and I’m turning 19 years old this year. I’m currently studying at UCSI University. The course I’m taking is Foundation In Science (Engineering) and in the future, I’m going to continue to study in the field of Engineering. The Engineering that I’m interested in is Mechanical Engineering. My hobby is playing Rubik's cube. I started playing Rubik's cube in 2018 and it has been 4 years. Now, I can solve it in under 15 seconds. When covid was still not a thing, I used to join Speedcubing Competition which was a competition that people compete by solving Rubik's cube fast. Besides playing Rubik's cube, I also like watching Japanese animation, also known as Anime. I’ve been watching anime for years. After watching anime for years, I'm now able to speak and understand Japanese quite well. At night, when I'm bored, I will join some Japanese voice calls and practice my Japanese.

                <h4>Nour Nader Nabil Salim</h4>
                <p>My name is Nour Nader, you can just refer to me as Nour just like all my friends do. I am 18 years old, born on the 5th of December 2003. I’m an international student, from Cairo, Egypt, currently studying Foundation in Science leading to Engineering. Engineering has been my passion since the first day I could remember. Coming from a family of engineers, it did help a lot in getting to know more about the field and the different disciplines of engineering as well as growing my passion more and more. Although no one in my family forced me to study engineering nor even influenced me to, I still chose it as I am genuinely interested in everything related to it. My hobbies are watching TV shows, running and reading. You can name any TV show and I would have probably watched it or at least heard about it. Another interest I have is accessories making. I used to own a small business, back in my home country, specialized in the making of 100% handmade accessories. I co-founded this business, which is named Ophelia, with my best friend and the days I worked in Ophelia were the best days of my life. Hopefully in the future I can re-open the business here in Malaysia.</p>
